    <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in chopped onions and bay leaf; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cloves minced garlic, oregano, and 2 teaspoons basil; cook and stir for 2 more minutes.</li>
    <li>Mix in undrained crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour. Stir in cinnamon and set pan aside.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 175 degrees celcius. Lightly grease a baking dish.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil, add lasagna noodles and bring water to boil again. Cook until noodles are al dente. Drain well.</li>
    <li>Bake the lasagna in preheated oven until filling is bubbly and cheese is melted and beginning to brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool 10 minutes before serving.</li>
